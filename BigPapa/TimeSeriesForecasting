The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.
Time series forecasting is performed in a variety of applications including:

    Weather forecasting
    Earthquake prediction
    Astronomy
    Statistics
    Mathematical finance
    Econometrics
    Pattern recognition
    Signal processing
    Control engineering
