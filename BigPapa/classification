A supervised learning approach.
Categorizing some unknown items into a discrete set of categories or classes.
Target attribute is categorical variable.
K-nearest Neighbours->
Decision tree->
Logistic Regression-> It is a classification algorithm for categorical variables.
when??
1. Binary
2. If you need probability results.
3. When you need a linear decision boundary.
4. If you need to understand the impact of a feature.

SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
SVM is a supervised algo that classifies cases by finding a separator.
1. Mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space
2. Finding a separator

Mapping data into a higher dimensional space is called kernelling.
The mathematical function used for the transformation is known as kernel function.
Types of kernelling :- Linear, Polynomial, (Radial Basis Function)RBF, Sigmoid

SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes.
ADv.
1. Accurate in high-dimension spaces
2. memory efficient; they use a subset of training point in the decision function called support vectors.
DisadV.
1. Algo is prone to overfitting, if the number of features > no. of samples
2. No probability estimation
3. Not good for small datasets

Whenn to use??
1. Image Rec.
2. Text category assignment
3. detecting spam
4. sentiment analysis
5. gene expression classification
6. regression, outlier detection
