Linear Regression -> Used to predict continous values.It involve independent variables and dependent variable. {y = a0 +a1x}
mean squared error MSE = (1/n)SIGMA{(yi^2 - Yi^2)^2} from 1 to n.
Pros.
Very Fast 
Basic
No Parameter tuning as in knn
Easy to understand and highly interpretable
======================================================================
Multiple LR
When??
Independent variables effectiveness on prediction
Predicting impacts of changes
Generally, the model is of the form: y ̂=θ_0+ θ_1 x_1+ θ_2 x_2 and so on, up to ... +θ_n x_n.
There are a number of ways to check for linear relationship.
For example, you can use scatterplots, and then visually check for linearity.
If the relationship displayed in your scatterplot is not linear, then, you need to use non-linear regression.

"training accuracy?"
1. Training accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes when using the test dataset on which it is trained too.
2. However, a high training accuracy isn’t necessarily a good thing.
3. For instance, having a high training accuracy may result in an ‘over-fit’ of the data.
4. This means that the model is overly trained to the dataset, which may capture noise and produce a non-generalized model.
"Out-of-sample accuracy" 
1. It is the percentage of correct predictions that the model makes on data that the model has NOT been trained on.
2. It’s important that our models have high, out-of-sample accuracy.
